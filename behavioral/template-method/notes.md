# Template Method

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is my personal notes of [Refactoring Guru's article on Template Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method). Visit their site for a complete version ðŸ¤“

### Notes

- **Intent**: defines the structure of an algorithm in the superclass and gives the subclasses the freedom to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing the said structure.

- **Problem:** consider an app for digitalizing music sheets. It receives a photo of the music sheet and outputs a pdf document with the music sheet digitalized. At the beginning, the app only generated PDF's, but users asked for other output formats, as editable MusicXML and audio files with the sheet being played. To generate the different outputs it takes different approachs, but they all have similar code structure. 
 
- **Solution:** break the algorithm inot a sequence of steps (methods) and define a *template method* to execute this steps in a specific  order. Then, the client provides a subclass which implements/overrides all steps required.  


- **Structure:**
  - **Abstract Class**: declares methods that act as steps of an algorithm and the template method that calls those steps in a specific order.
  - **Concrete classes**: can override/implment steps (but not the template method).

- **Applicability**
  - When clients should extend only particular behaviours of an algorithm and not the whole piece
  - When there's multiple classes with amost identical algorithms with small differences between them.  

### Output
